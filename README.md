# WebBased-QA-Forum-StackOVerglow

Stack Overglow is a simplistic version of Stack Overflow. It is a question and answering platform where signed-in users (we will refer this as users) can:
1. Post questions and answers
2. Upvote/downvote questions and answers
3. See their statistics in their profile page
4. Accumulate Presence
5. Select an answer as the best answer (for original poster only)

Both users and non-users, or browsers (a person who browses), can:
1. View questions and answers
2. Search questions to a limited extent.
